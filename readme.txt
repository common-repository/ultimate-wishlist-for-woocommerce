The "Ultimate Wishlist for WooCommerce" plugin allows you to implement wishlist strategies to your WooCommerce store in a way that was not possible before. Using this plugin, the admin lets the buyers give real meaning to their wishes, create and add products to their Wishlists, edit and delete them, share them with family and friends, and purchase products directly from the wishlist, anytime.

On the other side, the admin gets full analytics, what the buyer wishes for, which product is wished the most, etc. And, based on that, the admin can target the prospects, or implement other marketing strategies. All of these settings are accessible from one central platform in the WordPress dashboard, which you get after plugin installation. This wishlist plugin for WordPress allows you to manage everything from one central panel.
